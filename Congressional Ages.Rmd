Replication of the chart from "Both Republicans And Democrats Have An Age Problem," an [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/both-republicans-and-democrats-have-an-age-problem/) in *The New York Times.*

```{r}
data("congress_age")
congress_age %>%
  mutate(year = format(termstart, "%Y")) %>%
  filter(party %in% c("R", "D")) %>%
  group_by(year, party) %>%
  summarize(avg = mean(age)) %>%

ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg, group = party, color = party)) + geom_line() + labs(title = "Average Age of Members of Congress", subtitle = "At start of term, 1947-2013", x = "Year", y = "Average Age")
```
